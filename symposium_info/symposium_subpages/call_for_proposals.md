# Call for Proposals: MDLS 2025

The Midwest Data Librarian Symposium (MDLS) invites session proposals for its 11th symposium, co-hosted by Michigan State University (host site), University of Michigan, Wayne State University and Western Michigan University.  MDLS provides librarians who support research data management and research data services the chance to connect with colleagues and expand their research data-related knowledge base and skill sets. 


MDLS 2025 will be an in-person event held Monday, October 20 to Wednesday, October 22. The symposium will take place at the Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI, with 60 seats available for participants. Registration is free, and some meals will be included as part of the conference. Presenters are expected to attend the symposium in-person.

## Proposal Details:
- The greater research data community—not limited to data librarians—is invited to submit session proposals for consideration. Presenters from all disciplines and regions are welcome to apply, as well as librarians in training. 
- MDLS is an unconference-style event and does not specify a topical theme. We encourage proposals on all topics related to research data and data librarianship. Please review [past conference schedules](https://mw-data-lib-symposium.github.io/website/conf_archive/past_conference.html) for topic examples.
- We invite proposals in a wide range of formats, including lightning talks (5 minutes), presentations (15 minutes), panels (60 minutes), and workshops (90 minutes). We welcome suggestions of alternative formats such as discussions, games, etc. Priority will be given to sessions that emphasize practical approaches and interactive attendee participation.
- Proposals will be evaluated according to the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hCHUAnvTrOilK5XvENuzK8BVNfRJGExq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114782009173074304970&rtpof=true&sd=true).
- Proposals are due by 11:59pm EST on July 18th. Notification of acceptance will go out by email the week of August 3rd.
