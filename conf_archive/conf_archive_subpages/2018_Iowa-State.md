Does your library have a data visualization lab, provide data visualization services, or is it considering how to support data visualization in new ways? Do you offer data visualization support and services, whether as an individual contributor or as part of a larger team? Or are you simply curious as to what data visualization is or how you can play a role in supporting your patrons in this sphere? This session will provide an opportunity to reflect on the value of data visualization services, and engage in conversation with others to ask questions and share ideas, failures, and best practices for supporting data visualization.

- Eric Johnson (Miami University of Ohio) and Heather Shimon (University of Wisconsin-Madison) will highlight some of the ways in which data visualization is supported at their institutions in lightning talks.
