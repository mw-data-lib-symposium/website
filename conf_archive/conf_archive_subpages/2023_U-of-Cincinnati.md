**Heather Coates**  
Digital Scholarship & Data Management Librarian  
IUPUI  

**Mike Dickinson**  
Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Agriculture Librarian  
University of Illinois  

This highly interactive workshop will provide attendees with an opportunity to participate in a live demo of a generative AI tool and discuss the practical and ethical considerations of such tools. Using pre-created questions and tasks designed to represent the various domains of data professional work, the workshop facilitators will lead a live demonstration of the tool. Both the prompts and the responses will be captured in a shared Google document, which will be the basis for the small group discussions. Each small group will be assigned a brief set of questions to consider and discuss. These questions will touch on a variety of topics, including ethical principles and frameworks, quality of results, policy issues, and more. Each small group will record notes and a summary of their discussion in a shared document, as well as sharing with the larger group. These summaries will inform and lead into a large group discussion about the potential implications of generative AI tools in our work. The facilitators will document the large group discussion so that the shared notes document can serve as a resource for attendees.

Learning objectives:
1. Attendees will gain experience evaluating outputs from a generative AI tool.
2. Attendees will gain experience applying ethical principles for AI tools.
3. Attendees will gain experience reviewing policy for use of AI tools.
4. Attendees will consider how such tools may be used in research data management, sharing, and curation.

### Break Time, Lunch (provided), and Keynote
The keynote begins at 12:30

**When Data Is People: Ethics and Ownership in Research and AI Uses of Public Data** (Keynote) üî¥Live Streamed

**Speaker: Casey Fiesler**

In U.S. academic settings, research uses of publicly available data such as social media content typically does not fall under the regulated umbrella of human subjects research, and therefore is often overlooked in discussions of research ethics. Similarly, recent attention to Common Crawl and other widespread web scraping for the purposes of training AI such as ChatGPT has sparked conversation about both the legal and ethical implications of using public data without consent. This talk unpacks some of the ethical considerations for both of these contexts, with an emphasis on what questions academics should asking of themselves and the data they collect.

Casey Fiesler is an associate professor in Information Science (and Computer Science by courtesy) at University of Colorado Boulder. She researches and teaches in the areas of technology ethics, internet law and policy, and online communities, including research ethics and copyright issues online. Also a public scholar, she is a frequent commentator and speaker on topics of technology ethics and policy, and though her work has been covered everywhere from The New York Times to Teen Vogue, she is most proud of her TikToks. She holds a PhD in Human-Centered Computing from Georgia Tech and a JD from Vanderbilt Law School.

### Workshop

**Where to Share? Collaborative Exploration of Disciplinary Repositories**

**Kelsey Badger**  
Research Data Librarian  
The Ohio State University  

The Registry of Research Data Repositories currently lists over 3,100 domain-specific repositories. This distributed infrastructure for data sharing can be overwhelming for both researchers and data support professionals to navigate. What search strategies should be used to identify repositories? What criteria can be used to decide between similar disciplinary repository options? When should an institutional or generalist repository be used instead? In this workshop, participants will practice searching for and evaluating disciplinary data repositories by working together in small groups to make repository recommendations for a series of case studies. Each group will rotate through multiple case studies in a World Caf√© (http://unconference.net/methods-2/) style discussion. At the end of the session, groups will re-convene to compare which repositories were recommended and to discuss strategies for addressing challenges.

Participants in this workshop will practice the skills needed for repository consultations with researchers, including:
1. Navigating repository websites to identify key characteristics
2. Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of using a repository in a given context
3. Justifying and communicating a repository recommendation

### Break
3:30 - 4:00

### Workshop
4:00 - 5:30

**A Crowd-Sourcing Examination of Challenging Data Management Use Cases**

**Amy Koshoffer**  
Assistant Director, Research and Data Services  
University of Cincinnati  

Each data set has its unique data management challenges, and each institution has its unique set of resources. And at times we all feel that we do not have all the answers and could use some help. Who can we turn to when we need this help? Others in our field! In this interactive session, workshop participants will work collaboratively on data management use cases provided by conference attendees and others in the data management support environment. During the session, the attendees will break into groups and discuss the use cases, then share their conclusions with the group. The person who submitted the use case or the facilitator will then give a big reveal and explain what happened or where the case stands so the group can see how the choices may be the same or change based on resources at their institution. Through this session, attendees will learn of the various approaches taken to implement a data management solution with the outcome of a new set of tools and approaches for future data management work.

10:00 - 11:00

**Make it Hybrid and they will come: Challenges and Triumphs Arising from a Synchronous, Multi-institutional Carpentries Workshop Series**  
(Presentation)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Dani Kirsch**  
Research Data Specialist  
Oklahoma State University  

My R1 research university, in partnership with a mid-size university and a small HBCU, hosted a three-part Software Carpentry workshop earlier this year. We had instructors from all three institutions ‚Äì two librarians and an Associate Professor of Engineering Technology. Sessions occurred on Saturdays and were simultaneously live-streamed to two in-person locations and fully-virtual attendees. We used institutional supercomputers to enable participants and instructors to log in to cloud-based JupyterHub environments to easily access files and software during the interactive sessions. This approach improved digital equity among learners, as they only needed access to a computer and internet browser rather than specific hardware requirements and software installations. The in-person locations also provided laptops as needed. Participant assistance occurred both online and in-person, and we supplemented live coding from instructors with lines of script that helpers pasted into online chats.

Retention and engagement were strong across all three workshops, the JupyterHub infrastructure enabled learners to equitably participate, and it resulted in a positive collaboration between institutions that opened up Carpentries instruction to learners who may not have otherwise had access to it. On the other hand, there were some discrepancies between the supercomputing infrastructures, difficulties preparing helpers to provide support, and the familiar barrier of engaging with and identifying the needs of virtual participants.

This presentation will summarize the challenges and triumphs from this workshop series and give thoughts on improving similar collaborations in the future. It will also weigh the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid workshops with participatory elements, focusing specifically on ensuring access to participation and assistance for all attendees. There will be time reserved at the end for discussion and questions.

Outcomes:  
Attendees will be able to evaluate the various components involved with conducting multi-modal, participatory workshops and adapt our framework to implement similar workshops at their own institutions.

**Research Data Commons and Data Communities: Building bridges between institutional functions and informal communities**  
(Presentation)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Heather Coates**  
Digital Scholarship & Data Management Librarian  
Research Data Steward  
IUPUI/IU  

With support from our new Vice President for Research, Indiana University is establishing a Research Data Commons that draws upon expertise in the Libraries, IT, faculty researchers, and the VPR. The broad mission of this initiative is to serve as a university-wide resource for discovering, sharing, and accessing data resources across IU, to build on our centralized cyberinfrastructure, to present researchers with easier and more integrated pathways to data resources, to enable richer training opportunities for students, and to empower IU to better serve our partners locally and throughout the state. This presentation will describe opportunities for facilitating a community-based approach to research data stewardship within the context of this initiative. In particular, how might we foster greater connections between groups providing research support across IU, as well as bridging between research support groups and the emerging data communities that this initiative seeks to foster? How might developing stronger connections across relatively siloed communities both empower faculty to better manage their data and reduce the burden on them to navigate increasingly complex issues related to data protection, privacy, and reuse.

Learning objectives:  
Attendees will be prompted to consider how the needs of specific data communities can affect institutional and community research data stewardship.

**What is Out There? Data Services Offerings at R1 and R2 Doctoral University Libraries**  
(Presentation)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Chad Kahl**  
Data Services Librarian  
Illinois State University  

**Josh Newport**   
Math and Science Librarian  
Illinois State University  

**Lindsey Skaggs**  
Discovery Services and User Experience Librarian  
Illinois State University  

As librarians at a comprehensive university, we sought to understand the data service offerings among R1 and R2 university libraries to guide initial data services development at our institution. To do so, we undertook an environmental scan to discover the services, information, and resources promoted on R1 and R2 library‚Äôs websites, and aggregated our findings into a database for use by other librarians and data services professionals.

During the session, we‚Äôll share our methodology and findings and make the data available to attendees. We‚Äôll highlight how attendees can use this information as a tool for further development of data services at their own institutions, including how it may be used as a comparison point for lobbying for additional services or a professional development tool that can aid in identifying areas for professional growth.

### Presentations & Lightning Talks (CECH Library in Teachers College; Live Streamed)
10:00 - 11:00

**Teaching Data Literacy with Archival Collections**  
(Lightning Talk)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Daria Orlowska**  
Data Librarian and Assistant Professor  
Western Michigan University  

This lightning talk will cover the Collection as Data initiative at the University Libraries that strives to increase the accessibility of archival collections through the creation of computationally-ready datasets that were used as data literacy tools for community engagement. Increasing interaction with published datasets began with the development of K-12 lesson templates that sought to expose students to data literacy through the use of primary source materials in their social studies and science curricula. These templates were then adapted to a post-secondary education audience as a hands-on workshop demonstrating combining datasets, targeted analysis, good data management practices in research, and critically examining data sources from the past and present. Reflections about the project will touch on how data services were transformed to engage new audiences, and highlight how DEI will be integrated into the next phase. This talk hopes to inspire data librarians to highlight their physical materials, by working with their colleagues to consider how their physical collections can be reimagined into computationally-ready data that meet community needs.

**Engaging Student Interns with Data Curation Primers**  
(Lightning Talk)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Maria Lee**  
MLIS Student  
Simmons University  

The Data Curation Network hosted its second cohort of MLIS interns through the NNLM‚Äôs National Center for Data Services‚Äô data librarianship internship program which focuses on engaging Black, Indigenous and other students of color with data librarianship. Last summer three students worked on creating a Data Curation Primer for GitHub. In this session participants will hear from an MLIS student intern on Data Curation Primers, the experience of drafting a primer, a take away for other organizations hoping to build inclusive internship programs.

Talk attendees can expect to:
- Learn about the Data Curation Network and the Data Curation Primers as a resource.
- Hear a reflection from a recent MLIS student intern about working with primers and engaging with the Data Curation Network.
- Learn helpful tips for hosting interns and student workers in an inclusive, growth oriented environment.

**Balancing External and Institutional Needs in Internal Thesaurus Maintenance**  
(Presentation)

üî¥Live Streamed

**jay winkler**  
Assistant Archivist  
ICPSR- University of Michigan  

Thesauri, or controlled vocabularies, are long-established tools for improving how our users navigate and search our collections. New technologies and services provide opportunities to enhance and expand these legacy thesauri. The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research‚Äôs (ICPSR) own thesauri was developed decades ago and has been used by hundreds of thousands of students and researchers when browsing and searching the ICPSR catalog.

This presentation will discuss ways in which ICPSR can update our thesauri. For instance, can we completely switch to standardized identifiers, like ROR and ORCiD, rather than updating our own Organizational Names Authority List and Personal Names Authority List? How can we make better use of complementary thesauri, like the Library of Congress Subject Headings or the European Language Social Science Thesaurus? In what ways can we remediate terminology using outdated or non-preferred terms? Discussion points will include tradeoffs and resource costs.

**Developing Hands-on Data Management Exercises for New Research Staff at the Global Health Institute**  
(Lightning Talk)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Julia Hon**  
Data Services Specialist  
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation  

Our team of data librarians at a global health research institute is responsible for ensuring that our nearly 300 researchers are well equipped to find, intake, access and manage the data used in the health metrics models we produce. As users of secondary data, our researchers need to know how to comply with data use terms, track data for reproducibility, and find data from around the globe. Training on data management is delivered during onboarding, when staff have little on-the-job context for best practices and are inundated with new information. How can we make data processes and best practices ‚Äústick‚Äù as new hires transition to their day-to-day workflows?

In this talk, I will discuss a recent pilot project to develop a guided checklist of data skills for new hires to practice in their first three months on the job. The hands-on exercises in the checklist simulate actual data-related job tasks, provide a safe space for mistakes, and create a foundation for productive communication with data librarians. To develop the checklist we incorporated input from research managers and librarians as well as analysis of past researcher requests and questions, and tested it with a group of newer employees to get feedback. Our hope is that this space for practice helps to level the playing field for incoming researchers, who come from a variety of backgrounds, countries, and academic or non-academic contexts. By the end of this lightning talk, attendees will gain insight into data management practices at a large research institute and learn concrete strategies for developing a self-guided teaching tool of hands-on data-related exercises.

**Writing a Multisite NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan: A Quick Guide**  
(Lightning Talk)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Lena Bohman**  
Data Management and Research Impact Librarian  
Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell  

As the new NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy has gone into effect, data librarians have been called to help researchers with their DMSPs. One gap many of us are encountering is how to advise researchers on creating a DMSP for a multisite grant project. A colleague from compliance and I created a quick guide with recommendations for researchers on writing this type of DMSP. We included relevant FAQs released by the NIH, suggestions on what to include in specific data management and sharing plan elements for a multisite grant, information on sIRB (single IRB for multisite research), and selected examples of multisite DMSPs from DMPTool. In this lightning talk, I will share the practical suggestions we generated, most of which are applicable beyond our institution.

Learning Objective:  
After this talk, participants will be able to provide practical guidance to researchers with reference questions about DMSPs for multisite grants.

**Leaving the Laboratory: The Data Departure Checklist**  
(Lightning Talk)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Abigail Goben**  
Associate Professor and Data Management Librarian  
University of Illinois Chicago  

**Kristin Briney**  
Biology and Biological Engineering Librarian  
California Institute of Technology  

What happens to data when a researcher leaves an institution? In the optimal situation, there is policy and guidance for handoff of data and materials to collaborators and the institution. More commonly, however, some research data gets lost in transition, either because it was never handed off at all or because transfer of data or documentation was incomplete. This makes it difficult-to-impossible for collaborators, let alone those outside of a research group, to reuse the research data. The data departure checklist aims to streamline the handoff of critical research materials when a researcher leaves an institution, making sure that key decisions have been made to maximize transparency and data reusability. The checklist covers 8 areas: hardware; personal devices; systems; permissions and authorship agreement; data; manuscripts in progress; administration; and email. This presentation will introduce the current version of the checklist and identify opportunities for customization and implementation.

**Testing New Technology: ChatGPT vs. DMP Tool**  
(Lightning Talk)

üî¥Live Streamed

**Amanda Tickner**  
GIS Librarian  
Michigan State University  

**Jessica Sender**  
Health Sciences Librarian  
Michigan State University  

The requirements for the new NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan require researchers to outline their intent for managing data long term, and the submission of a data management plan with their grant application. This lightning talk will show the results of experimentation with ChatGPT and the DMPTool to develop a data management plan that is compliant with NIH guidelines. We will examine the results of this experimentation and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using ChatGPT versus using the DMPTool to write a data management plan.

### Workshop (CECH Library in Teachers College)
3:00 - 4:30

**Fostering Inclusion in a Digital World**

**Tiffany Grant**  
Assistant Director for Research and Informatics  
University of Cincinnati  

The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a new normal, where virtual, is often our reality. As we navigate the potential landmines of diversity, equity, and inclusion in spaces where seeing each other is often optional, (camera on/camera off), ensuring inclusion is difficult at best. In these virtual spaces, the diversity of participants is often hidden, leaving facilitators ignorant of the makeup of their audiences. In this workshop we will explore the necessity of inclusion and the impact of exclusion on audiences, seen and unseen. We will explore methods used by our library to foster inclusion and facilitate cooperative conversations among participants.

Participants will be encouraged to bring their own devices, as participants will be asked to assess their own bias(es) by taking one of three Implicit Association Tests (race, disability, and sexual preference) and report out these results either verbally or anonymously. The results from these tests will be used to discuss the intersection between bias and privilege and how these can impact engagement with participants in both physical and virtual spaces. Workshop participants will learn how aspects of emotional intelligence can be employed to overcome implicit biases. Finally, participants will interactively discuss case studies involving inclusion and teaching, and actively employ lessons learned to create a more inclusive environment in the instances studied. Through their participation in this workshop, participants will learn to recognize their own biases, ways to overcome them, and how to facilitate more inclusive workshops in virtual and physical spaces.

In the past 20 years, the role of the librarian and the information field as a whole has changed drastically. Data and technology have become increasingly instrumental to the functioning of our world. As a result, library jobs have become more technical as institutions are seeking out more data and tech-savvy individuals. Such new positions include the data librarian, whose role can differ widely amongst libraries and other institutions. Through a roundtable-style discussion, drawing from the perspectives of three MLIS students who participated in the Summer 2023 NCDS Data Librarian internship, participants will be part of an invigorating conversation surrounding the trials and tribulations of the journey to becoming a data librarian. The session will encompass each participant‚Äôs personal experiences during the NCDS Data Librarian internship, highlighting the responsibilities and skill sets required in their roles. Furthermore, as this roundtable will be led by early professional librarians, the discussion shall emphasize the importance of managing realistic expectations to mitigate imposter‚Äôs syndrome, particularly for interns and early career librarians. The session will also explore the importance of mentors and address barriers to entry in the data scholarship landscape.

Learning Objectives:
- Attendees will develop a comprehensive understanding of the role of a data librarian within the dynamic and evolving Ô¨Åeld of librarianship, speciÔ¨Åcally exploring the increasing signiÔ¨Åcance of data and technology.
- Attendees will gain insights for overcoming challenges in their own journeys towards becoming data librarians through engaging discussions that unveil the obstacles and triumphs experienced by each participant.
- Attendees will examine the signiÔ¨Åcance of internship in shaping the skills, knowledge, and career path of aspiring data librarians.  
- Attendees will be better equipped to support the growth and development of early career professionals in the data librarian Ô¨Åeld.
