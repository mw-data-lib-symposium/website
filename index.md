## **About**  

### **What**  

The Midwest Data Librarian Symposium (MDLS) is intended to enable Midwestern librarians who work with research data management issues the chance to network; however, it is open to all who wish to attend, including future “data librarians” and those situated outside the Midwest.  
  
MDLS’s goal of providing low-cost networking and educational opportunities has inspired two “sister events” in 2018: [Mountain West Data Librarian Symposium](https://mountainwestdls.github.io/) and [South East Data Librarian Symposium](https://se-datalibrarian.github.io/).

### **When & Where**  

**MDLS is held in October and the location changes every year.**  
  
MDLS 2025 will take place October 20-22 at Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI. Conference events will be held at the Michigan State University Main Library, 366 W. Circle Drive.
